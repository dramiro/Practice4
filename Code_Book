## Code book
Here, it describes the variables, the data, summaries calculated, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). T
The R script file is called run_analysis.R which generates the output file tidyData_aggregated.txt
